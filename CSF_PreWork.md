#COMPUTER SCIENCE FUNDAMENTALS
###COURSE PREWORK

Congratulations on joining us at General Assembly for the Computer Science Fundamentals course! We are so excited to have you and looking forward to working with you all soon!

In order to best prepare you for this course, we’ve gathered a list of resources that we’d like for your to complete prior to beginning the course on **12/2**. So when you arrive on your first day, we will all be up to speed and be familiar with the vocabulary and programming languages necessary to succeed in this course.

Throughout this course, you will be exposed to the Java programming language and various software engineering tools, so in order to be most prepared we recommend going through the following tutorials and resources so that you start the course off strong.   We estimate this will take you approximately **5 – 6 hours**.
